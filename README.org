* raindrop

Read a value from an i2c device (in this case a raindrop resistance
sensor on a Raspberry Pi) and make the value available via http
requests using Flask and WSGI. The `/inline/` path returns the data
formatted for consumption by Telegraf/InfluxDB.

Make sure that the user that the web server runs as has permission to
access i2c. On my Raspberry Pi, this was done by:

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo usermod -a -G i2c www-data
#+END_SRC

apache2 runs as user *www-data* and members of group *i2c* can access
the i2c interface.
